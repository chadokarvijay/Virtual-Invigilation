# Virtual-Invigilation
In this project, we have designed a remote proctoring model using Python language and various modules.. In it we have demonstrated how digital form invigilation can be implemented using audio, video and various anti-cheating techniques. This model includes checking and recording the suspicious motion of the candidate, background noises along candidate validation too. It aims to conduct a remote examination without manual invigilation, the recorded snaps and noises can also be reviewed to decide whether the candidate indulged in unfair means or cheating.
